        <h2>Description</h2>
        This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
        topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce
        from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk,
        Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats
        every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni
        and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or
        alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.

        <ul>
          <h4>• 8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• ¼ cup salted butter</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• 2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</h4>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>• salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</h4>
        </ul>

        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
          square baking dish.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>
          Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted
          water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
          tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking
          in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>
          While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet
          over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes
          paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>
          Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a
          simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses;
          season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese
          is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2
          cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir
          until well combined.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>
          Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet
          over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated
          and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then
          sprinkle with paprika.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni
          and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
